      What was Kubrick's A.I supposed to be about? </B><br>

<i>This answer was written in 1999, and therefore only deals with the story of what was known then about the pre-production of Kubrick's AI</i><br><br>
      A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) was a film Kubrick had planned on making 
      for several years. The film was to be his first foray into the science-fiction 
      genre since his 1968 technical ground-breaker '2001: A Space Odyssey'.
      <p> Kubrick worked with several writers over the years, shaping the script, 
        Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw and Ian Watson, among others (the latter actually 
        finished a script for Kubrick), meanwhile he kept one eye on the latest 
        developments in the field of special effects. The script was partly based 
        on Brian Aldiss' short story 'Supertoys Last All Summer Long' <font size=3><a href="#s14n">(1)</a></font> 
        "Super Toys" Is a fable about a young synthetic boy and his talking companion 
        bear. The boy is confused about his existence and what is 'real' and if 
        he is indeed 'real' himself. The boy's 'Father' works for a company that 
        manufactures artificial people as servants, companions and to keep the 
        booming population under control. 
      <p> The Father and Mother both want a real child through conception, but 
        await official permission to do so. In the end they are elated to be granted 
        permission, but seem puzzled at what to do with their artificial child 
        and its companion. 
      <p> The basic thesis for the story appears to be a reworking of the Aldiss 
        short story, but the plot and narrative structure seem less familiar. 
        Kubrick had envisioned a New York of the future being swallowed up by 
        floods and tidal waves. More specific plot-points are vague, but several 
        of the contributors have leaked glimpses of the story line over the years. 
        One such scenario, given to me anonymously, would be that sometime later, 
        a boy would be found amongst the swamp-like ruins by an advanced group 
        of robots. At some point it would become clear that the boy himself was 
        an arcane version of these robots, long since forgotten.
      <p> This scenario is a far cry from the 'Waterworld'-like plot of Ballard's 
        'Drowned World' (1962'), which has long been rumoured to have been a source 
        for the film, but has never been confirmed. The novel describes that in 
        the latter half of the 20th century, the world has become immersed in 
        water due to a melting of the Earth's polar caps. The story begins several 
        decades after the catastrophe. Survivors spend their days avoiding the 
        blistering sun, living on makeshift boats or in the high rises that break 
        the swampy surface of the underworld. Coincidentally, Brian Aldiss gives 
        the book a glowing review on the back cover, which at least proves the 
        main contributor to the story - aside from Kubrick - had at least read 
        it and had likely drawn some inspiration, however small.
      <p> Although Kubrick's story was apparently to have tidal waves crashing 
        through cityscapes, there is no such mention in Ballard's book. However, 
        there are some brief descriptions of waves that splash methodically against 
        the sleek skyscrapers that protrude from the water's surface. This single 
        vision at least seems in tone with Kubrick's visual atmosphere for the 
        film. 
      <p> What is more likely - at least on a personal level - is Watson's scenario, 
        which would follow the Aldiss story closely, but would spin off into a 
        more 'fairy-tale' journey that would take the viewer on a odyssey spanning 
        the boy's thousand year quest.
      <p> David (as he was named in Watson's script) was the first of a new model 
        of robot able to utilize 'virtual' emotion as part of its psychological 
        makeup. In Watson's script, it is apparent that David has been programmed 
        to love the couple that has acquired him, but cannot 'learn' to love others. 
        David's new 'parents' are a dissatisfied couple whose only child suffers 
        from an incurable disease and had been cryogenically preserved in case 
        a cure can be found. The parents are not allowed to have another child 
        and resent David playing the part of their 'child'. 
      <p> When a medical breakthrough allows the daughter to be thawed out and 
        cured, David becomes redundant, and after a period of intense sibling 
        rivalry, the mother decides to rid herself of David. She sets him loose, 
        but to assuage her sense of guilt, tells him that he can return when he 
        becomes a 'real boy'. 
      <p> David's quest eventually takes him to the drowned city of New York , 
        where he finds a 'Pinocchio booth' at a Coney Island amusement park, which 
        is, along with a Ferris-wheel, located just above the waterline. The scene 
        ends with David seeing the model of the 'Blue Fairy', which he regards 
        with referential wonder. 
      <p> The story then jumps ahead a thousand years, to a future in which robots 
        populate the world which is now run by computers. Humans are long extinct. 
        David's remains are discovered, his battery worn down, and revived by 
        these robotic inheritors of the Earth, who regard him as a link with a 
        mythological long-forgotten past. <br>

        <i>Ian Watson did an almost full novel length treatment which I've never 
        seen and when he finished it Stanley said to him. I need somebody to smear 
        this with vaginal jelly, and I have to say when I first heard this that 
        I was rather shocked, because he was quite gentlemanly. </i>
        <p><i>Sara Maitland. </i><br>
        <hr noshade width=80%>
        <br>
      </blockquote>
      Kubrick's final collaborator on the 'A.I' script was English novelist Sara 
      Maitland whom he felt was necessary in shaping the story into a cohesive 
      whole. "By the time I came to the project it had become enormous, unwieldy 
      and unfocused," said Ms. Maitland. Upon perusing the piles of unfinished 
      scripts, she concluded that the story needed to make emotional sense as 
      a myth or fairy tale does, and believes that Kubrick realized this. In fact 
      Kubrick also was adamant that the story should work in terms of myth. "He 
      never referred to the film as 'A.I.'; he always called it 'Pinocchio.' " 
      <p> "He decided to make this film because he wanted people to shift to a 
        more positive view of A.I., he was quite open to me about that. Kubrick 
        was fascinated by artificial intelligence and fond of robots, which he 
        regarded as a more environmentally adaptable form of human being. He said, 
        'I think of them as I'd like to think of my great-grandchildren.' And 
        he's very fond of his grandchildren." 
      <p> It was the relationship between David and his mother that most occupied 
        Kubrick and Sara Maitland. An alcoholic whose 'Bloody Mary' cocktails 
        David would mix for her in a vain attempt to win her affection. The mother 
        was the to be emotional center of the film that would eventually come 
        full-circle. 
      <p> At the story's conclusion, the robots that have inherited the Earth 
        use David's memories to reconstruct, in virtual form, the apartment where 
        he had lived with his parents. Because his memories are subjective, the 
        mother is much more vividly realized than the father, and his stepsister's 
        room is not there at all; it is just a hole in the wall. 
      <p> For Ms. Maitland, the film would end with David preparing a Bloody Mary 
        for his mother, the juice a brighter red than in real life: "He hears 
        her voice, and that's it. We don't see him turn to see her." Kubrick, 
        however, wanted a coda in which the new race of robots, because of a technological 
        limitation, cannot keep the mother alive after reviving her. The movie 
        would end with David in his mother's bedroom, watching her slowly disappear. 
      <p> Ms. Maitland was displeased this scenario, and was furious with Kubrick 
        for insisting on it. "It must have been a very strong visual thing for 
        him," she says, "because he wasn't usually stupid about story. He hired 
        me because I knew about fairy stories, but would not listen when I told 
        him, 'You can have a failed quest, but you can't have an achieved quest 
        and no reward.' "
      <p> Other details regarding the film have recently surfaced, but specifics 
        are vague and sometimes just utter nonsense (we'll get to the nonsense 
        soon enough). But the few hard facts we have about the film come from 
        this source, a statement from Warner Brothers and a confirmation from 
        Industrial Light And Magic about being approached to deal with the special 
        effects shots. 
      <p> The statement form Warner Bros. was released during pre-production for 
        'Eyes Wide Shut' and states: 
      <p> "...Kubrick's previously announced sci-fi film, 'A.I.', believed to 
        be one of the most technically challenging and innovative special effects 
        films yet attempted, is in the final stages of set design and special 
        effects development, and will follow Eyes Wide Shut".
      <p> The confirmation from Industrial Light and Magic's involvement has always 
        been - until now - unclear to say the least. But a recent article from 
        the June 18th issue of Entertainment Weekly confirms that members of ILM 
        were indeed deep into development in regard to special effects for the 
        proposed film. 
      <p> In the fall of 1993, Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman, who had previously 
        wowed audiences with the effects for the 'Star Wars' films, had been invited 
        to the Kubrick estate to talk about the monumental effects issues for 
        Kubrick's new film, 'A.I.'. Kubrick had begun pre-production in 1991, 
        but had lost interest when it became apparent the effects shots needed 
        for the film were beyond the capabilities of even the top special effects 
        people. A recent screening of Muren and Gorman's newest work on Steven 
        Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' rekindled his interest in the project. 
      <p> At his estate, Kubrick was shown a screening featuring a computer generated 
        pirate ship on the high seas. According to both Muren and Gorman, Kubrick 
        was left duly impressed, and grilled the two FX whizzes for over seven 
        hours. The two also indicated that Kubrick's level of knowledge in the 
        field of FX was astounding.

      </center>
    </td>
    <td width=71%> <font face="times new roman, times", size=4> For the lead role, 
      Kubrick had wanted the robot boy something along the lines of an androgynous, 
      Victorian doll. Muren and Gorman were shown a photo of Gainsborough's painting 
      <a href="html/blue.html" border=0 target="image">'The Blue Boy'</a> as an 
      example. Kubrick's concept was that the child should look a little too real. 
      And although it would become apparent that he wasn't human, he would in 
      the end, become the most humane character in the film. 
      <p> When the ILM team returned to the U.S., they conjured up about fifty 
        or so different ways visually to make it apparent that the child was indeed 
        a synthetic creation. One such suggestion, which certainly plays into 
        Kubrick's 'Pinocchio'-type odyssey for the boy, would be that of an internal 
        manifestation or mechanism; some semblance of lights coming from inside 
        the body. Another was symmetric freckles and moles on the child's face. 
        Yet another idea was to give the child blank, doll-like eyes, that wouldn't 
        focus on a point in space, but off into nowhere. 
      <p> One idea in particular sparked Kubrick's interest, and that was to have 
        the boys face inhumanly balanced. In particular, the idea that the eyes 
        might be farther apart than that of a human being. These spatial differences 
        are what Kubrick was especially intrigued by. Whether Kubrick was to use 
        a real actor and superimpose the head and face in post-production, or 
        create a fully digitized actor is still unknown. 
      <p> Kubrick did eventually commission a test helicopter shot of an oil derrick 
        in the North Sea, which he intended to digitally replace with the sunken 
        spires of the New York City skyline. How these images of monuments rearing 
        up from the oceans turned out is any ones guess. With no explanation, 
        his interest temporarily waned, and he turned his attention to 'Eyes Wide 
        Shut'. 
      <p> What Kubrick could have done with today's digital technology is something 
        that will be debated for decades to come. For now, Kubrick's dreamlike 
        fable will play out only in the midst of our imagination.

      RUMOR MILL. WHAT'S TRUE, WHAT'S FALSE? READ ON... 
      <p> TRUE: &nbsp; 1996, an amk contact received <a href="html/ai.html" border=0 target="image">art 
        work</a> from AI. The artwork is an early draft, in later versions the 
        side walls are huge ice formations." The metal arch type structure the 
        two craft are lifting would represents a ruined Ferris Wheel encased in 
        ice, and being harvested out by machines.
      <p> Later the same informant reported AI, "has been shelved." An artist 
        was hired to work at Stanley's house, to produce pictures of the Polar 
        ice caps and of the Statue of Liberty under water. But after several months, 
        the artist produced only one painting, and was let go from the project. 
        The source did confirm the script was based on "Supertoys," dismissed 
        the "kid from Jurassic Park" rumor, and reported that people were working 
        with Stanley on computer morphing techniques.
      <p> Later message: The source says that he'd be surprised if AI even gets 
        started after EWS. It seemed likely that if it did happen, Kubrick would 
        create his own effects team, because he wasn't happy with the ILM's work 
        and its cost estimates. He couldn't confirm Ian Watson's involvement. 
        Then the messages concerning AI ended after this.
      <p> NOTE:<br>
        THE ABOVE INFORMATION HAS NEVER BEEN REVEALED BEFORE, AND IS COPYRIGHT 
        OF THIS SITE!!
      <p> FALSE: &nbsp; An outlandish rumor began on 'Dark Horizons, about Kubrick 
        secretly shooting 'A.I.' over the course of several years <font size=3><a href="#s15n">(1)</a></font>, 
        in order to capture the child star's age progression into adulthood realistically. 
        Jan Harlan recently called this "Total nonsense," but adds, "... we did 
        test Joseph and he was put on a contract, but then he didn't do the film." 
      <p> TRUE: &nbsp; What we do know is that Kubrick was impressed with the 
        young actor after seeing him in 'Jurassic Park', and possibly wanted him 
        to play a major role in the holocaust drama 'Aryan Papers' <font size=3><a href="#s15n"> 
        (2) </a></font>, which Kubrick had intended to either produce or direct. 
        Mazzello's agent has publicly stated his client was put under contract 
        for two years, but that when the contract expired, renewal was not sought 
        out by Kubrick, who by then had turned his interests to 'A.I' and 'Eyes 
        Wide Shut'. 
      <P> TRUE: &nbsp; Video director and artist Chris Cunningham (Bjork - 'All 
        is Full of Love'; Aphex Twin - 'Come to Daddy') was hired by Kubrick to 
        make little robot-type humans for A.I., and that he did spend time with 
        him actually making a few of them. Jan Harlan recalled to Steven Rose 
        of the Guardian "We did try to build remote control machines and stuff 
        like that. We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face 
        to see whether we could make it look appealing. But it was a total failure, 
        it looked awful." 
      <P> INTERESTING FACT: Kubrick consulted with <a href="html/morevec.html" target="1">Hans 
        Moravec</a> of Carnegie-Mellon University, whose book on artificial intelligence 
        "Mind Children" became Kubrick's standard reference. 
      <p> INTERESTING FACT: Kubrick also commissioned the British illustrator 
        Chris Baker to draw scenes for his future world. 
      <p> TRUE: &nbsp; He was working on pre-production on AI and EWS simultaneously. 
        Terry Semel told Paul Joyce, <font size=3><a href="#s15n">(3i)</a></font> 
        "He was preparing "AI" for some time, as he was "Eyes Wide Shut" and he 
        was determined after the screenplay that collectively we did not go forward 
        on it, which was really his choice. He decided to have more than one choice 
        the next time. So he took an extra year or two and was working on more 
        than one project at the same time. One was Eyes Wide Shut and the other 
        was AI.
      <p> FALSE: &nbsp; The film was shooting concurrently with EWS in a St. Albans 
        property that used to be a bacon factory that Kubrick had bought and converted 
        in to a studio. Although Chris Cunningham, built robots for Kubrick there 
        and it has been reported that parts of Eyes Wide Shut were indeed shot 
        in the converted bacon factory. 
      <p> TRUE &nbsp; Contrary to what has been reported here before, Steven Spielberg 
        received over 900 pages of fax-notes from Kubrick, regarding AI. Jan Harlan 
        Kubrick brother in law said to Steve Rose of the Guardian "He and Spielberg 
        spoke all the time," he continues. "I have six or seven years' worth of 
        correspondence between them over AI, which I recently passed over to Spielberg 
        along with over 1,000 drawings." Harlan told Paul Joyce, <font size=3><a href="#s15n2">(3ii)</a></font> 
        "He said on more than one case - "I think the ideal director for this 
        may be Steven Spielberg. If I do it, it may be too stark. I may emphasise 
        too much the philosophical side. 
      <p> Harlan maintains that Kubrick would certainly have returned to AI after 
        Eyes Wide Shut. "He had no intention of dying, I assure you. But at one 
        point, Stanley actually said to Spielberg: 'You would be the best guy 
        to direct this film, I'll be the producer.' I can't tell you whether he 
        would have directed it himself or given it to Spielberg. That was still 
        very much a possibility." <font size=3>(4)</font>

      (1) Interestingly at around the same time as this rumour appeared, Danish 
      director of Lars Von Trier announced that he intended doing the same kind 
      of thing, taking a 3 minute shot every year on different locations all over 
      Europe for a period of 33 years. Von Trier's film, if it is ever completed, 
      is expected to premiere in the year 2024. &nbsp;<a href="#slot15">(back)</a>

      or abandoned projects that Kubrick worked on?</b><br>
      Take one director of exacting standards and a penchant for pre-production 
      combined with a forty eight year career making films and you are bound to 
      find a string of uncompleted, abandoned or half-forgotten projects along 
      the way. Here is a brief, although probably far from comprehensive, r&#233;sum&#233;.
      <p> Some of the abandoned projects mentioned in this list were in a more 
        advanced stage of development than others, although apart from <i>AI</i> 
        and <i>Napoleon</i>, lack of information makes it difficult to ascertain 
        which ones, hence the list is arranged in alphabetical order and approximately 
        dated. 
      <p> <b>AI </b><br>
        From a short story by Brian Aldiss<br>
        Kubrick became interested in doing a film about artificial intelligence 
        in the early 70's and the idea stayed with him for the rest of his life.

        From 'Wartime Lies' by Louis Begley (published 1977)<br>
        <u>Synopsis</u>: <br>
        A Jewish Mother and Son try to escape the Nazi holocaust. <br>
        <u>Development</u><br>
        According to a recent interview in the UK Guardian newspaper with Jan 
        Harlan "Kubrick always wanted to do a film on the Holocaust, but he never 
        got a good script." He had tried to commission an original screenplay 
        from the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer (who turned it down on the grounds 
        that he knew nothing about the Holocaust), before settling on an adaptation 
        of the novel Wartime Lies, by Lewis Begley. 
      <p> Script written, though not known whether other writers were involved. 
        Uma Thurman and Julia Roberts were considered for the female lead while 
        Joseph Mazzello had been selected to play the young boy. Locations had 
        been chosen but the film was cancelled a few months before principal photography 
        was to begin.
      <p> "We were very committed to do this film," Harlan recalls. "We had done 
        enormous amounts of research and preparation, but there came a point when 
        he and Warner boss Terry Semel decided it would be better to do AI first. 
        It had to do with Schindler's List," he said. "It was such a good film 
        and so successful, and Stanley's film would have come out about a year 
        later. He'd already had this experience with Full Metal Jacket, which 
        came out the year after Platoon, and that hurt us, there's no question 
        about it." So in 1995, The Aryan Papers was abandoned and Kubrick returned 
        to AI.

        a film director who becomes so great and famous that he gets the financing 
        to make the ultimate pornographic film starring two well-known screen 
        lovers (This story sparked rumours that <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> was going 
        to be Kubrick's Blue Movie). <br>
        <u>Development</u>:<br>
        Kubrick toyed for a while with <i>Blue Movie,</i> although it's doubtful 
        he ever seriously considered making it into a film. Terry Southern liked 
        the idea so much that he got Kubrick's permission to write the story as 
        a novel. According to Vincent Lobrutto's biography, Kubrick asked Southern 
        if he could read the galleys to the novel. While he was reading it, Christiane 
        picked it up and, after perusing the pages, said to her husband, "Stanley, 
        if you do this I'll never speak to you again." In the early 1970s Kubrick 
        also confessed to a friend once that he would like to make the world's 
        scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the 
        nightmare fears of the audience (<i>The Shining</i> was released in 1980).

        Screenplay written in the mid 1950s by Calder Willingham and Kubrick for 
        MGM to follow up The Killing. Harris and Kubrick worked on the project 
        in the day whilst developing Paths of Glory surreptitiously at night. 
        Management changes at MGM scuppered the project. A version was later directed

        finally struck a deal with Fine Line Features for a big screen adaptation

        The hard hitting sexual, political and criminal adventures of a series 
        of characters living in Brooklyn in the 1950s. The book became famous

        Kubrick, wrote a 186 page script for Columbia as early as 1969. He later 
        rewrote it with Napoleon expert Felix Markham. There is no way of ascertaining 
        whether a version was ever finished, but they did spend many months writing 
        it. Anthony Burgess' cited Kubrick as the influence on the choice of subject 
        matter for a novel which he wanted to write, structured like a classical 
        symphony. His book 'Napoleon Symphony' <font size=3><a href="#s16n">(1)</a></font> 
        came out of soon afterwards and was also thought to be a contender for 
        adaptation into a film script.<br>
        <u>Synopsis</u>:<br>
        The Life of Napoleon (possibly structured like Beethoven's 3rd symphony 
        "Eroica":- The first part being about struggle and victory, the second 
        about a great public funeral, and in the third and forth raising the hero 
        to the level of myth).<br>
        <u>Development</u>:<br>
        A project that was developed from the late sixties to the early seventies 
        and cancelled for various reasons by MGM, Kubrick or a combination of 
        the two. There is evidence that the project was cancelled in the final 
        stages of extensive pre-production; certainly casting had begun and locations 
        were being decided upon.
      <p> Of all his abandoned projects, Napoleon (and AI) were the most prominent 
        also-rans. (Napoleon even received a mention in Arthur C. Clarke's 'Rendezvous 
        with Rama'!) Originally slated to follow <i>2001,</i> then <i>A Clockwork 
        Orange,</i> Kubrick discussed Napoleon at some length in several interviews 
        <font size=3><a href="#s16n">(2) </a></font> around the late 1960s early 
        1970s. With Jack Nicholson confirmed to play the eponymous emperor, Kubrick 
        plans for Napoleon would have made it easily the most ambitious project 
        he had ever attempted. The film was to feature battle sequences filmed 
        by helicopter with thousands of troops marching in historically accurate 
        formations. Certainly, if the film had ever been made, it would have been 
        to be an epic on the grandest of scales.
      <p> Years later, after the release of Full Metal Jacket, Penelope Gilliatt 
        <font size=3><a href="#s16n">(3)</a></font> asked Kubrick what had happened 
        to the film. "I'm not sure that in three hours you could do justice...."

      <p> The final scenes of 2001 depict Bowman; taking an interstellar journey, 
        arriving at an alien white room and turning into a star child. Kubrick 
        was often drawn by interviewers to offer his own interpretation of these 
        enigmatic events but would not discuss them, due he said to the conviction 
        that by providing such a road map, he would destroy the mystery of the 
        film. He did say to Rolling Stone magazine about the film that, "On the 
        deepest psychological level the film's plot symbolizes the search for 
        God, and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition 
        of God [...] The film revolves around this metaphysical conception and 
        the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were 
        necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical 
        concept. " 
      <p> Arthur C. Clarke's novelisation, published after the films release seemed 
        to many to explain the ending of the film more clearly, although purists 
        are quick to point out that the novel differs in many key respects from 
        the film, and should therefore not be regarded as the skeleton key to 
        unlock it.
      <p> Certainly most people are in agreement on the following: that the room 
        seems to represent some kind of interface between the aliens and Bowman. 
        Perhaps a test? Or a <a name="n2s17"></a> cage of some sort? And his transformation 
        into the baby is a kind of step up the evolutionary ladder for humanity.
      <p> It is worth noting a quotation in an article from the New York Times, 
        circa 1966 in which Kubrick gave credence to interpretations of <i>2001</i> 
        based of the book 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' (Thus Spoke Zarathustra) by 
        German philosopher Frederick Nietzsche. In the article, Kubrick appropriated 
        Nietzsche's dictum that: 'man is a bridge between the apes and the Supermen; 
        a laughing stock,' when he said: "Man is the missing link between primitive 
        apes and civilised human beings Man is really in a very unstable condition." 
        <font size=3><a href="#s17n">(2)</a></font> The other indication of a 
        Nietzsche connection is the choice of Richard Strauss' tone poem, 'Also 
        Sprach Zarathustra' for the title music to 2001.

      <font size=4> <a name="slot18"></a><b>18&#47; I noticed there is a record 
      of the 2001 soundtrack on prominent display in A Clockwork Orange, does 
      Kubrick make references to his own work in any other of his films?</b><br>
      There are SO many of these references that some have suggested the links 
      might mean SK is creating one giant film over the course of his whole career. 
      <p> 
      <i>From the Rolling Stone interview, 1987
      <p> Tim Cahill <br>
        People always look at directors, and you in particular, in the context 
        of a body of work. I couldn't help but notice some resonance with Paths 
        of Glory at the end of Full Metal Jacket: a woman surrounded by enemy 
        soldiers, the odd, ambiguous gesture that ties these people together..." 
      <p> Stanley Kubrick<br>
        "That resonance is an accident. The scene comes straight out of Gustav 
        Hasford's book. 
      <p> Tim Cahill <br>
        "So your purpose wasn't to poke the viewer in the ribs, point out certain 
        similarities..? "
      <p> Stanley Kubrick <br>
        "Oh, God, no. I'm trying to be true to the material."
      </i>
      <p> Although Kubrick was publicly dismissive about connections in his films 
        his above statement needs to be set against the sheer amount of evidence 
        to the contrary.
      <p> Here are a few of connections, but please note: this list is not definitive.
      <p> <b>Paths of Glory &#47; 2001</b><br>
        The large painting in <i>Paths of Glory</i> looks like the landscape that 
        opens <i>2001. </i> Also, both films use "The Blue Danube".
      <p> <b> Paths of Glory &#47; The Shining</b><br>
        In <i>Paths of Glory</i> the character Private Arnaud played by Joe Turkel 
        says: "May I tell you something, Father? Back in my hometown there was 
        a certain little cafe with a amusing sign over the bar. It read 'Do not 
        be afraid to ask for credit, for our way of refusing is very polite.' 
        Many years later, Turkel played the bartender in <i>The Shining, </i> 
        reassures Jack that: "his credit's fine"
      <p> <b>Paths of Glory &#47; Dr. Strangelove &#47; Barry Lyndon &#47; Full 
        Metal Jacket.</b><br>
        The looking down the barrel of the rifle shot
      <p> <b> Spartacus &#47; Lolita</b><br>
        In <i>Lolita,</i> Quilty played by Peter Sellers says, "No, I'm Spartacus. 
        You come to free the slaves or something?"
      <p> <b> Lolita &#47; Dr Strangelove </b><br>
        Peter Sellers plays multiple roles in <i>Lolita</i> and <i>Dr Strangelove.</i>
      <p> <b>Lolita &#47; 2001</b><br>
        "You lost your new sweater?" asks Charlotte in <i>Lolita. </I> "A woman's 
        cashmere sweater has been found..." says the intercom in <i>2001. </i>
      <p> <b>Lolita &#47; The Shining</b><br>
        The hand opening the bathroom door shot is the same.
      <p> <b> Lolita &#47; The Shining</b><br>
        Humbert makes love to Charlotte while looking at a picture of the younger 
        Lolita over Charlotte's shoulder. Jack kisses the naked woman in the bathroom, 
        then sees her older, decomposing reality in the mirror over he shoulder
      <p> <b>Dr Strangelove &#47; 2001</b><br>
        The false-colour landscapes near the end of the 'stargate' trip in <i>2001</i> 
        are similar to the high-altitude scenes during the bomb run in <I>Dr Strangelove. 
        </i> (In fact Kubrick used out takes from <i>Dr Strangelove</i> for the 
        Stargate planet shots in <i>2001</i>&nbsp;).
      <p> <b>Dr Strangelove &#47; 2001 / A Clockwork Orange </b><br>
        The radio in the B52 bomber is 'CRM114' in <i>Dr Strangelove, </i> the 
        serial number of one of one of the pods in <i>2001</i> pod is 'CRM114' 
        and Alex is injected with 'serum 114', in <I> A Clockwork Orange</i>
      <p> <b> A Clockwork Orange &#47; The Shining</b><br>
        Alex cuts the back of Dim's hand in <i>A Clockwork Orange; </i> Wendy 
        cuts the back of Jack's hand in <i>The Shining. </i>
      <p> <b> A Clockwork Orange &#47; The Shining</b><br>
        The posters in the Milkbar in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> are a great deal 
        like the ones in Hallorann's apartment in <i>The Shining.</i>
      <p> <b> Barry Lyndon &#47; A Clockwork Orange </b><br>
        In <i>Barry Lyndon</i> a painting by Ludovico Corde is bought by Barry, 
        in <i>A Clockwork Orange, </i> the Ludovico treatment is given to Alex.
      <p> <b> Barry Lyndon &#47; A Clockwork Orange </b><br>
        Anthony Sharp plays the role of Lord Hallan - a 'former government minister' 
        in <i>Barry Lyndon, </i> the same actor played the Minister of the Interior 
        in <i>A Clockwork Orange. </i>
      <p> <b> Barry Lyndon &#47; Eyes Wide Shut </b><br>
        One of Dr. Bill's encounter with the Mysterious Woman at the masked ball 
        is very reminiscent of Redmond Barry's first encounter with Lady Lyndon 
        at the gambling party. 
      <p> <b> Eyes Wide Shut &#47; 2001 </b><br>
        In <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> there is a poster with "Manning Bowman" written 
        on it. Bowman was the commander of the first manned mission to Jupiter 
        in <i>2001</i>. 
      <p> <b>The Shining &#47; Eyes Wide Shut </b><br>
        Jack's awakening from a nightmare and and tells it to his wife , Alice's 
        awakening from her nightmare and tells it to her husband. Another Jack 
        / Alice connection is Jack wants to stay in the hotel "forever and ever 
        and ever" while Alice tells Bill not to use the word forever because it 
        scares her.
      <p> <b>A connection that never made it to the screen...</b><br>
        Canadian actor Douglas Rain was the voice of HAL in <i>2001</i> Kubrick 
        quoted in Agels Making of Kubrick's 2001 said, "maybe next time I'll show 
        Rain in the flesh, but it would be a non speaking part, which would perfectly 
        complete the circle."

        <a name="slot19"></a><b>19&#47; Has Kubrick worked on any other films 
        apart from his own?</b><br>
        Kubrick worked on very few films made by other people, mostly when he 
        was just starting out and under the wing of Richard de Rochemont, the 
        producer of the March Of Time, who help the fledgling director finance 
        his first feature <i>Fear and Desire.</i>
      <p> <b>a)</b> In the early 50's Kubrick took a job as second unit director 
        on the "Omnibus" television series in the US for Richard de Rochemont. 
        He work on some ofd the 5 episodes of the life of Abraham Lincoln. Kubrick 
        was brought in to work on Lincoln for about a week shooting second unit<a name="slot19a"></a> 
        in Kentucky.
      <p> <a name="slot19_1"></a><b>b)</b> Kubrick's directorial flair had caught 
        the eye of Marlon Brando and he hired him for six months for a fee of 
        a reported $100,000 to work on a screenplay and direct the Western "One 
        Eyed Jacks (originally penned by Sam Pekinpah) with Marlon Brando and 
        Calder Willingham as co-writers. When Kubrick took a look at the script 
        he knew at once that it "needed work," and pitched in to solve its inherent 
        problems. Five months later, after a series of conferences with Brando 
        and associates, his contractual time was up, and he left the film. Kubrick 
        has said that the relationship ended amicably a few weeks before Marlon 
        began directing the film himself.
      <p> <a name="slot19_2"></a><b>c)</b> Ken Adam reported that Kubrick helped 
        him set up the lighting of the tanker set of <i>The Spy who Loved Me.</i> 
        They had built the set but the director of photography was afraid how 
        the whole thing was going to be lit. Adams asked Kubrick to come in for 
        some advice and he agreed on the condition that no one knew what was going 
        on. He was afraid it might cause a bit of a ruckus and was also supposed 
        to be working on 'The Shining' at the time. So when no one else was about, 
        he creeped in to help with the set-ups.

        <a name="slot20"></a><b>20&#47; What is the inspiration for the title 
        "Eyes Wide Shut"?</b><br>
        There are several theories about who came up with the title, and what 
        it means, but no definitive answer. The following is collection of possibilities: 
      <p> In early June of 1999 Frederick Raphael was asked to write an article 
        for New Yorker Magazine entitled 'A Kubrick Odyssey', about his experiences 
        working with Stanley Kubrick on what was to become Eyes Wide Shut.
      <p> Raphael became concerned with a lack of title for the project when they 
        were deep into rewrites and faxed Kubrick a possible contender: 'The Female 
        Subject.' Kubrick reportedly did not acknowledge receipt of this suggestion 
        but some days later proposed 'Eyes Wide Shut' as the title he had decided 
        upon.
      <p> There has been much speculation on amk as to what the title means and 
        where it originated. The most popular contention is probably that he took 
        it from a 1968 congratulatory fax from film director Franco Zeffirelli 
        for '2001.' Zeffirelli said: 'You made me dream with my eyes wide open.' 
        <font size=3><a href="#s20n">(1)</a></font>
      <p> Another reference points to Kubrick's friend John Le Carr&#233;'s novel 
        "The Night Manager" which was written in 1993 which is about an arms dealer 
        who seems as charming as Zeigler, just about as cold blooded. On page 
        270 of the US hard bound edition a very distraught femail character finally 
        realizes she is little more than a gangster's moll and says "I'm in deep 
        shit. I walked into this with eyes wide shut." 
      <p> Recently it was suggested that it might have been inspired by a quotation 
        by Benjamin Franklin: "Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half 
        shut afterwards." Strangely enough, Raphael might have been more responsible 
        for the title than he was aware. for in his 1980 novella based on the 
        myth of Gyges, 'The Hidden I' <font size=3><a href="#s20n">(1)</a></font> 
        he wrote: "Now what was left of that airless complicity in which nothing 
        (she swore) could come between them? Now she was enlightened. Her eyes 
        were open while his were shut. She saw it all".

      <p><font size=3> (3) The Hidden I: A Myth Revised by Frederic Raphael with 
        illustrations by Sarah Raphael was published in the UK by Thames And Hudson 
        in 1990. Kubrick was aware of "The Hidden I" because Raphael mentions 
        giving him a copy to him in his memoir of their collaboration. </font>

      <a name="slot21"></a><b>21&#47; Why did Kubrick omit the last chapter of 
      A Clockwork Orange in his filmed version?</b><br>
      Burgess offers his own explanation in the second volume of his autobiography, 'You've Had Your 
      Time.'
      <p> &#34;A Clockwork Orange was published in New York by WW Norton Inc. 
        later in the year. Eric Swenson, Norton's vice-president insisted that 
        the book lose its final chapter. I had to accede to this lopping because 
        I needed the advance, but I was not happy about it. &#34;
      <p> When Burgess first viewed Kubrick's film he realised he had followed 
        the American edition of the book
      <p> Kubrick's opinion was expressed to Michel Ciment in an interview. 
      <p> MC<br>
        The end of A Clockwork Orange is different from the one in the Burgess 
        book.
      <p> SK<br>
        There are two different versions of the novel. One has an extra chapter. 
        I had not read this version until I had virtually finished the screenplay. 
        This extra chapter depicts the rehabilitation of Alex. But it is, as far 
        as I am concerned, unconvincing and inconsistent with the style and intent 
        of the book. I certainly never gave any serious consideration to using 
        it.
